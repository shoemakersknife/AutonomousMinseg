**Autonomous MinSeg Robot**

![image4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/542aaa4a-f305-480d-a5a2-bb1493cd3393)

Designed and implemented a structurally modified MinSeg robot capable of obstacle avoidance.

Involves arduino microcontroller programming, PWM motor control, sensor integration, and CAD design.

Smooth acceleration/deceleration algorithms using custom PWM ramping to prevent motor jerk and maintain stability.

*Hardware components*

-MinSegMega V4 Board: Arduino Compatible Mega 2560 (compatible with Arduino IDE)

-DRV8833 motor driver

-I2C header and other headers for additional sensors

-MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer 3-axis gyro, temperature sensor  (eventually unused but was able to monitor acceleration)

-Ultrasonic sensor 

-DC Motor with Encoder and wheels 

-6AA (9v) battery holder (battery covers are not included)

-Retractable USB Cable

-3D printed leg

Conducted iterative testing and system tuning to ensure reliable detection and consistent behavior.

Debugged embedded code using serial monitoring, improving system responsiveness and preventing collisions.
