**Autonomous MinSeg**
Designed and implemented a structurally modified MinSeg robot capable of obstacle avoidance.
Involves arduino microcontroller programming, PWM motor control, sensor integration, and CAD design.

*Hardware components*
-MinSegMega V4 Board: Arduino Compatible Mega 2560 (compatible with Arduino IDE)
-DRV8833 motor driver
-I2C header and other headers for additional sensors
-MPU6050 3-axis accelerometer 3-axis gyro, temperature sensor  (Unused)
-Ultrasonic sensor 
-DC Motor with Encoder and wheels 
-6AA (9v) battery holder (battery covers are not included)
-Retractable USB Cable
-3D printed leg

Tuning code for deceleration responsiveness
Iterative debugging needed to avoid collisions
